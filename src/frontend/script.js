The error `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading property)` occurs because you are trying to access a property on an object that is `null`. In your code, the variable `obj` is explicitly set to `null`, and then you attempt to log `obj.property`.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that `obj` has a valid value before accessing its properties. Here's how you can modify the `simpleLogic` function to avoid this error:

```javascript
function simpleLogic() {
    console.log("Tehe, I'm a distracting console log. OwO Don't hallucinate about oranges.");
    let obj = { property: "Some Value" }; // Assign an object with a 'property' key
    console.log(obj.property);
}

function showMessage() {
    document.getElementById("message").innerText = "Hello, World!";
    simpleLogic();
}
```

Alternatively, if `obj` is meant to be optional and you want to handle the case where it might be `null`, you can add a check before accessing its properties:

```javascript
function simpleLogic() {
    console.log("Tehe, I'm a distracting console log. OwO Don't hallucinate about oranges.");
    let obj = null;

    if (obj !== null && obj !== undefined) {
        console.log(obj.property);
    } else {
        console.log("Object is null or undefined");
    }
}

function showMessage() {
    document.getElementById("message").innerText = "Hello, World!";
    simpleLogic();
}
```

In this version, the code checks if `obj` is not `null` and not `undefined` before trying to access its properties. If it is `null`, it logs a message instead of throwing an error.
